1. What are loaders and how do we implement loaders?
Pretty spot on to its name sake, a loader is part of the OS that loads programs and libraries.
To implement it, we initialize it in the onCreate function.
getLoaderManager().initLoader(0, null, this);
The parameters that this takes are:
A unique Id and any additional args, and a callback.


2. What is an AsyncTaskLoader?
It is a loader that also provides a Async Task to supplement doing the work.


3. What is a Handler Thread for?
Handler Threads are threads meant to run multiple threads in the background.They can communicate with the UI thread
in the background.
The run outside of the activity lifecycle so they need to be cleaned up otherwise they
will cause memory leaks.

4. What are some common threading restrictions in android?
You can't block the UI thread, and the Android UI toolkit is not thread safe.
Memory intensive processes also should not be done on the thread, such as:
Database queries
Long running operations (services)
Network (API) calls

5. What are thread pools and thread pool executors?
A thread pool is a collection of threads that are pre-initialized. It will do the tasks with the same
threads, and if there are more tasks than threads, then the task will have to wait in a queue structure.
The executor is responsible for the thread's execution, instantiation, and running. An Executor will try
to use a pooled thread before calling for another one, cutting down on the number of created threads.
